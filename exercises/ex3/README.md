# Exercise 2 - Build an Integration Package

In this exercise, we will wrap your current implementation such that it can be used by other applications.

## Packaging

```sh
npm pack
```

## Publishing

### Locally

Move the `tgz` file to ...

### Via NPM (optional)

```sh
npm publish
```

## Summary

You've now packaged and published your work to a place where it can be found by other applications.

In the next [exercise 3](../ex3/README.md), you will see how such a package can be embedded again into an application.
